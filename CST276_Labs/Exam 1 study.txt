EXAMPLE:
	Template Method
	
	Definition:	Encapsulates an algorithm and delegates to subclasses to implement the algorithm steps.
	
	
	
	Singleton:
		Ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it
		
			Singleton::GetInstance()
		
	Factory:
		Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
		Lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

	Abstract Factory:
		Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
		
			Abstract Factory

			Abstract Product
			Product
			Client
			
	Template Method
		Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
		Lets sublcasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
		Allows the base class to control the algorithm, and the subclasses to implement the steps.
		
			Abstract Class
			Concrete Class
			
	Strategy
		Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
		Lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
